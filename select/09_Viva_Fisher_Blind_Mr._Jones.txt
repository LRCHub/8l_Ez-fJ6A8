Six down, five letters - unfilled,
Beginning with E.
The answer is empty.
Empty, beginning with me.

And round it goes again,
I'm fighting for air when I'm with you.

Doubt me, too easy.
That's easy, beginning with E.
I told you, you've got to believe more,
Beginning with me.

And round it goes again,
I'm fighting for air when I'm with you.
